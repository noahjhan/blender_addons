# Image K-Means Clustering and Processing

## Description

This is a collection of various addons for Blender - 3D Graphics Software. 

Currently developing a tool to compress and convert image files to a normal mapping.

This project provides a C++ file for performing K-Means clustering on an image, allowing you to process and quantize the colors of an image. The image is loaded as a vector, processed with the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar colors, and then saved back as a new image.
